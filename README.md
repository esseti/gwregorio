## Misc
Name is in honor of the inventor of the calendar Gregorio XIII. 
It's based on Google Workspace, thus  the name is GWregorio (GW->Goolge Workspace). 
The pronunciation is - somehow - like  if you have a Lisp (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) . Somehow like in Monty Python's Life of Brian.
